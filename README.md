## What is this
Lycoris also called as ``Abstract craft`` or ``Hi, vanilla!``, there are all kinds of unexpected situations that you can't expect in your Minecraft!

For example, Lycoris let entities leave the leash knot with a probability of one in a thousand, let the bed explosions in the overworld, let the result of lava meeting to water be other blocks, and other more happening, you have to discover this yourself!

## Game version
Only support newest version, but able to run in other versions if mixin available.

## Spoiler
